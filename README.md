# Ad-Hoc Project using SQL and Power Bi 

Hi folks, this repository contains all related resources/files needed and prepared by me for this project.

In this project, I have derieved insights from 209 distinct customers having 9.7lakh transactions.
For solving business problems, I initially load the data in my database using MS-SQL server.
Then checking the all columns data-types, if any null values, etc. doing all primary checks.
Then I solved 10 major business problems/requests using SQL-Server. Which help Ad-Hoc derieving the best results.
Then onwards, I pull the data from sql server in Power Bi and cretaed the best insights which helped Ad-Hoc to get customers output.
All the visualization is easy and clear to understand to the bank manager.
